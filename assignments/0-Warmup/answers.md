### Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

I would like to get a better understanding of systems programming and architecture, especially the more detailed stuff like OS and threads.

### Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

This is a retake for me - I have previously taken this course and passed, but with a C-. I aim to retake it and receive a C this term so that it can fulfill a pre-requisite requirement for another class I need for graduation. As such, I expect to struggle a bit, since I only received a C- last time.

I also wasn't able to add this class until the last day of add/drop period on Friday, so I missed the first week of lectures, but will do my best to catch up with the recordings and slides so that I'm not behind on the material. That's also why this assignment is a day late, and I understand on Blackboard it seemed like there would be no late submissions, but hopefully it is understandable that I was not even aware of the assignment until it was already almost too late. 

I have a habit of being dissatisfied with my work and ending up not submitting anything, but I plan to work on that this term and submit all of my assignments on time.
